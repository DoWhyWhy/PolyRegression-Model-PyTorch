While the linear regression model can provide some good predictions too, the polynomial regression sometimes proves out to perform better in certain situations over the linear regression models."

    "- Implementation of a machine learning model in **PyTorch** that uses the Polynomial Regression algorithm to make predictions.\n",

    "We will create the model entirely from scratch, using basic PyTorch tensor operations.\n",
