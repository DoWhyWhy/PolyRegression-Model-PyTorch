<h2>Project Objectives</h2>

* Implementing a machine learning model in PyTorch that utilizes a polynomial regression algorithm to make predictions. Building the model entirely from scratch, using basic PyTorch tensor operations.
* The model is used for predictive analysis of automobile prices. The end goal is to develop an efficient ML model that can predict the price of a car based on its features.
* Analyzing data both visually & descriptively to predict which features play a significant role in determining the price of a car.

<h2>Understanding the Problem Statement</h2>

The task is a predictive-modelling, regression problem where the model needs to predict the price of the car, given a set of features. The dataset used in the project is raw and needs to be preprocessed. Also, from the
