<h2>Project Objectives</h2>

* Implementing a machine learning model in PyTorch that utilizes a polynomial regression algorithm to make predictions. Building the model entirely from scratch, using basic PyTorch tensor operations.
* The model is used for predictive analysis of automobile prices. The end goal is to develop an efficient ML model that can predict the price of a car based on its features.
* Analyzing data both visually & descriptively to predict which features play a significant role in determining the price of a car.
